# Data Structures & Quicksort Implementation

## Description

This repository contains implementations of basic data structures (Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List) using fixed-sized arrays, as well as a solution to finding the `i`-th order statistic using the **Quicksort** algorithm. All data structures assume integer storage and are implemented using C-style arrays.

### Contents

1. **Quicksort Implementation for `i`-th Order Statistic**
    - **Description**: This task leverages the Quicksort algorithm to implement a solution for finding the `i`-th smallest element in an unsorted array.
    - **Average Time Complexity**: O(n log n)

2. **Data Structures: Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List**
    - **Description**: Basic implementations of Stack, Queue, and Singly Linked List, which simulate the behavior of these structures using fixed-size arrays. Each data structure includes essential operations such as push, pop, enqueue, dequeue, insert, delete, and search.

## Data Structure Implementations

### Stack
- **Implemented Operations**:
  - `push()`: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
  - `pop()`: Removes the top element from the stack.
  - `peek()`: Returns the top element without removing it.
  - `isEmpty()`: Checks if the stack is empty.
  - `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the stack.

### Queue
- **Implemented Operations**:
  - `enqueue()`: Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
  - `dequeue()`: Removes an element from the front of the queue.
  - `isEmpty()`: Checks if the queue is empty.
  - `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the queue.
  
### Singly Linked List
- **Implemented Operations**:
  - `insertAtBeginning()`: Inserts an element at the beginning of the linked list.
  - `insertAtEnd()`: Inserts an element at the end of the linked list.
  - `deleteNode()`: Deletes a node containing a specific value.
  - `search()`: Searches for an element in the list.
  - `display()`: Displays the entire linked list.
