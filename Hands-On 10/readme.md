# Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree, and AVL Tree Implementations

This repository contains implementations of three tree data structures in Python:
1. **Binary Search Tree (BST)** - A basic, unbalanced binary search tree.
2. **Red-Black Tree (RBT)** - A balanced binary search tree using color properties and rotations.
3. **AVL Tree** - A balanced binary search tree using height-based rotations.

Each tree implementation includes:
- **Insertion**
- **Deletion**
- **Search**
- **In-order Traversal**

## Testing
Each data structure has test cases to verify the correctness of its operations.
